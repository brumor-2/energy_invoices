# Energy Invoices ‚Äì Electricity Bill Processing (Python)

[üáßüá∑ Read in Portuguese](https://github.com/brumor-2/energy_invoices/blob/main/README-pt.md)

This project automates the processing of electricity bills (PDF format) from ENEL for 70 schools.  
The script scans a specific folder for PDF files, renames each file according to the school's name and installation number, extracts the invoice amounts, and generates an Excel spreadsheet with a summary and total value.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas (Excel manipulation and export)  
- `os`, `re`, `openpyxl` or equivalent libraries for file handling and PDF parsing  

---

## What I Learned
- **Batch file renaming** with a custom mapping based on school and installation number  
- **Data extraction from semi-structured PDF documents**  
- **Data consolidation in Excel**, including total calculations  
- **Real-world Python scripting**, combining file handling, data parsing, and automation  
- **Clear documentation** for reproducibility and adaptation to other contexts  

---

## How to Use
1. Place all PDF bills in the `input_pdfs/` folder.
2. Adjust the mapping in `energy_invoices_base.py` to match your school/installation data.
3. Run:
   ```bash
   python energy_invoices_base.py
The output.xlsx file will be generated with renamed files and a consolidated spreadsheet.

‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
You must adapt the school mapping for your own use ‚Äî sensitive data is not included in this repository.

The PDF pattern must match the ENEL invoice format for the extraction to work correctly.
